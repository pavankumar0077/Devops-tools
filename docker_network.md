IMP NOTES
--
SENARIO 1
--

1) Here we have 2 containers and 1 is front end container and 2nd is backend container and this 2 containers should communicate with each other.
2) Frontend -- should talk to backend.
3) There should be a networking way to talk to each other.
4) Any container will definitly talk to the host be'coz containers are package or bundle which don't
  have complete operating systems.
Subnet : Basically a networking group
