# Security Scans


- Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Examines source code, bytecode, or binary code
without executing the program.
- Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Simulates real-world attacks by testing running
applications from the outside.
- Container Security Scans: Focuses on scanning container images for known vulnerabilities.
Dependency Scanning: Identifies vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Security Scans: Evaluates security configurations in
infrastructure code.
- Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST): Combines elements of SAST and DAST by
testing applications during runtime.
- Secrets Scanning: Scans for hardcoded secrets and credentials in code repositories.
